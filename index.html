    <h1>If P is the proposition "It will rain today", then ¬P is the proposition "It will not rain today."</h1>
    <p>Propositional logic is a branch of mathematical logic that studies the logical relationships between propositions (statements that can be either true or false). In propositional logic, propositions are represented by symbols, such as P and ¬P in the example above, and logical operators, such as "and", "or", and "not", are used to combine and manipulate these propositions.</p>
